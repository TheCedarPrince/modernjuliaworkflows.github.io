# Quickstart for new programmers

\toc

## Welcome to the world of Julia programming!

We are glad to have you joining the world of programming!
Modern Julia Workflows serves as the entry point for both beginner programmers and beginner Julians alike(the affectionate name for Julia programmers).
If you are completely new to Julia, we encourage you to peruse the original vision of Julia in the now classic blog post, [_Why we created Julia_](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/).
If you are curious to learn more about the history of Julia, please see the [Lore section of "Going Further"](/pages/further#lore). 

## Where to get started?

The majority of Modern Julia Workflows assumes that readers already are familiar with Julia (or programming in general).
But, a quick start to learning Julia programming using both resources within Modern Julia Workflows as well as across the Julia ecosystem would be the following:

1. Basic guides on resources used within the Julia ecosystem

  i. [StartHere.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/StartHere.jl) - a useful look up project to find out about commonly used terms in the community

  ii. [Modern Julia Workflow's "Getting help" section](/pages/writing#getting_help) - a list of places within the Julia ecosystem to interact with community members and get help on your journey

2. Getting started with Julia:
